## EPIC-IDP : A Python tool for calculating effective interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins

### About
EPIC-IDP (Effective Protein Interaction Calculator for Intrinsically Disordered Proteins) is a Python package for calculating effective interactions between intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) species which can be used to predict their partitioning inside biomolecular condensates. Given a set of fasta sequences, the package calculates a matrix of effective Flory-Huggins $\chi$ parameters between all pairs of sequences which quantifies their interactions. The $\chi$ parameters are obtained using a combination of mean field theory for non-electrostatic interactions and Gaussian fluctuation theory (Random Phase Approxination) for Debye-screened electrostatic interactions. 

### Features

Interaction scales.

### Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install epic-idp
```

### Usage


#### Example

(Think of a simple example)

### Effective Flory-Huggins parameters from random phase approximation theory
